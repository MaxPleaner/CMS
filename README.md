Grapes.JS is a super cool project, but it's really an editor library, not a full featured CMS.

This project wraps it up in a CMS.

More docs forthcoming.

A bit about architecture:

1. The `gh-pages` branch of the Grapes.js repo is copied in here, and I deleted the git history
because working with submodules is kind of annoying.
2. There's a sinatra server which wraps it
